/* MessageRequestImpl is both a concrete command object and a MessageCommand.
 * Like all command objects, it keeps a reference to the receiver. In this case
 * it is set by the invoker on the server side (perhaps there is a better way to
 * do this...I'll leave that to you in the lab!). Note that the instance variable 
 * for the reciver is transient. This prevents the Receiver instance from being
 * serialized with the rest of the class. Also note the class field 
 * serialVersionUID. If you do not explicitly set this, the compiler will 
 * generate one for you. As the serialVersionUID is used as a version control
 * variable in serialization, letting the compiler generate it can lead to problems 
 * in client/server environments.
 * 
 * When the invoker calls execute() on this command object, execute() in turn calls 
 * update() on the receiver. Through the power of polymorphism, this object can 
 * behave as both a command object and a message request.
